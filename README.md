Project 1: Coffee Sales Data Analysis
1. Introduction
The Coffee Sales Data Analysis project focuses on understanding sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, and revenue trends in a coffee business. The dataset contains transactional-level information that helps analyze how different products, quantities, and prices contribute to overall business performance. This project is designed to demonstrate practical data analytics skills such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and business-oriented insights.
The main objective of this project is to help stakeholders understand sales patterns, identify highperforming products, and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability. This analysis can support decisions related to inventory management, pricing strategies, and promotional planning.
2. Dataset Description
The dataset consists of coffee sales records stored in CSV format. Typical attributes include product name, quantity sold, unit price, total sales amount, and transaction dates. Each row represents a single sales transaction. The dataset is structured, clean, and suitable for analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
Key features of the dataset: - Transaction-level sales data - Numeric fields for quantity and revenue - Timebased fields useful for trend analysis
3. Methodology
The analysis begins with data loading and inspection to understand the structure and data types. Missing values and inconsistencies are checked and handled appropriately. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
Common operations include: - Aggregating total sales by product - Calculating revenue contribution Identifying best-selling and low-performing items - Analyzing sales trends over time
4. Tools and Technologies
•	Python
•	Pandas, NumPy
•	Matplotlib / Seaborn
